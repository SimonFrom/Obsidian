**Encapsulation** **in object oriented programming**  
Encapsulation is a principle that seeks to hide the implementation details of objects from the outside world. It states that all important information is contained within the object; only selected data is available externally. Each object's inner workings and state are stored privately within the specified class, whereas other objects do not have access to it or the ability to make changes. Instead, they can only interact with a few public functions or methods. This form of data hiding provides program security and control over object state changes, reduces the risk of errors, and makes the program more understandable.
 
**Inheritance** **in object oriented programming**  
Inheritance is a principle that enables developers to create new classes based on existing (parent) classes, with the option of overriding or augmenting their properties and methods. This is especially useful in programs containing thousands of lines of code, as it simplifies maintenance and prevents code duplication. By using the logic of the parent class in the child class, developers can create objects that share code or logic yet are different. This reduces the complexity of the code and eliminates the need to create a new object for each object used in the program.
 
**Polymorphism** **in object oriented programming**  
Polymorphism is a principle that complements inheritance by allowing objects of different classes to perform actions with the same name using different code. For instance, the "show information" method can be used to display varied data about objects of the "car", "plane", or "ship" type. Furthermore, polymorphism helps to create more flexible and modular programs. Generally, it simplifies the development process as it allows for the creation of common methods and functions to be used for multiple types of objects.
 
**Abstraction** **in object oriented programming**  
Abstraction helps you focus on a system's essential elements and ignore the less important details that have no effect on its key features. It allows you to construct more understandable programs. Abstraction can be thought of as an expansion of encapsulation. Take programs that contain thousands of lines of code as an example. Through the principle of abstraction, each object only reveals a specific mechanism for usage. Therefore, the code inside becomes largely independent of other objects. For instance, in a program that stores information about movies, you can create a class "Movie" that provides access to only the most essential details, such as title, release year, and genre, while hiding the less important information, like shots or technical aspects.
